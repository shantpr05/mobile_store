We used semantic HTML elements like <main>, <header>, <nav>, and <form> to ensure screen readers and assistive tools can navigate the app easily. All interactive elements like buttons, links, and form inputs are keyboard-accessible. We used Bootstrap to build a responsive layout that works across devices and screen sizes. For SEO, we used `react-helmet-async` to set dynamic `<title>` and `<meta>` tags for each route, improving discoverability. Each page has a unique title and description to reflect its content.
