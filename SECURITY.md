Our app is protected against common web vulnerabilities. JWT tokens are stored in HttpOnly cookies, which prevents JavaScript-based attacks like XSS from stealing tokens. We use bcryptjs to securely hash user passwords before storing them in the database. Routes are protected using middleware that checks authentication and role-based access. Admin-only features like editing or deleting products are restricted both in the frontend and backend.
One specific threat we mitigate is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). By storing JWTs in cookies with the HttpOnly flag, we ensure that even if malicious scripts run on the page, they cannot access authentication tokens. This significantly improves the security of user sessions.
